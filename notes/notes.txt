TODO: Finally, I figured out what the problem is. Turns out that Win NT use NUL instead of /dev/null thus causing errors. I'll fix it later.

The problem must be the shell and how it pass data back to the buffer.

>go to eshell or shell
>type in $>ack akarin
>LANG error

This doesn't happen with naked shell or cmd.

This plugin however works.

(defvar ack-command "ack --nogroup --nocolor ")
(defvar ack-history nil)
(defvar ack-host-defaults-alist nil)
(defun ack ()
  "Like grep, but using ack-command as the default"
  (interactive)
  ; Make sure grep has been initialized
  (if (>= emacs-major-version 22)
      (require 'grep)
    (require 'compile))
  ; Close STDIN to keep ack from going into filter mode
  (let ((null-device (format "< %s" null-device))
        (grep-command ack-command)
        (grep-history ack-history)
        (grep-host-defaults-alist ack-host-defaults-alist))
    (call-interactively 'grep)
    (setq ack-history             grep-history
          ack-host-defaults-alist grep-host-defaults-alist)))
